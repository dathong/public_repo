Could you please provide me with your booking reference number?\n\n\n\nCUSTOMER: I don't have the reference number handy, but I can provide you with my name and flight details if that helps.

Could you please share more about why you need to cancel your flight?\n\n\n\nCUSTOMER: I understand the policy, but unfortunately, I really need to cancel this flight due to some unforeseen circumstances.

However, as per our policy, restricted tickets are non-refundable and non-changeable.

One option could be to convert your ticket into travel credits, which you can use for future travel with us. Another option could be a one-time rescheduling of your flight, although this would be subject to applicable fees. \n\nI understand that these options might not be ideal, but they are the best we can offer under the circumstances. I hope this information is helpful, and I'm here to assist you further if you have any more questions or concerns.\n\n\n\nCUSTOMER: I appreciate your understanding, but I really need a full refund for this ticket.

For instance, we could potentially convert your ticket into travel credits for future use, or possibly reschedule your flight subject to applicable fees. Would you like me to look into these options for you?\n\n\n\nCUSTOMER: I appreciate your understanding, but I really need a full refund for this ticket. I understand the policy, but I'm facing some unexpected circumstances that require me to cancel this trip. Is there any way you can make an exception in this case and provide me with a full refund?\n\n\n\nAGENT: I'm really sorry to hear about your situation. At Yale Airline, we do understand that unexpected circumstances can arise. However, our policy on restricted tickets is quite firm due to the nature of these lower-cost tickets. \n\nThat being said, in extraordinary situations such as a serious medical emergency or death in the immediate family, we may consider exceptions. This would require appropriate documentation, such as a medical certificate or death certificate, and would need to be escalated to a supervisor for review. \n\nIf your situation doesn't fall into these categories, I'm afraid we can't provide a full refund. However, as mentioned earlier, we can look into alternatives like travel credits or rescheduling your flight. \n\nI understand this may not be the ideal solution for you, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. If you're not satisfied with this, I can escalate this matter to my supervisor for further assistance. Would you like me to do that?\n\n\n\nCUSTOMER: I understand your policy, but unfortunately, my situation doesn't fall under the categories you mentioned. I really need a full refund for this ticket. I would appreciate it if you could escalate this matter to your supervisor for further assistance. Thank you for your help.\n\n\n\nAGENT: I completely understand your situation and I'm sorry for the inconvenience. I will escalate this matter to my supervisor for further assistance.

I appreciate your willingness to help and look forward to hearing more about the options available within your policy regarding non-refundable and non-changeable tickets.\n\n\n\nAGENT: Thank you for providing your booking reference number. I have verified your details, and it appears that you have indeed purchased a restricted ticket, which is non-refundable and non-changeable as per our policy.\n\nI understand that this might not be the news you were hoping for, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. The reason we have these restrictions is because these tickets are offered at a lower cost, and the terms and conditions are agreed upon at the time of purchase.\n\nHowever, we do have some alternative options for you. While we can't provide a full refund, we can offer you travel credits equivalent to the value of your ticket, which you can use for future travel with us. Alternatively, we can look into rescheduling your flight, although this is subject to a rescheduling fee.\n\nI hope one of these options might work for you. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed, or if you have any other questions or concerns.\n\n\n\nCUSTOMER: Thank you for explaining the situation and the alternative options available to me. I appreciate your offer of travel credits or the possibility of rescheduling the flight, despite the restrictions on my ticket.\n\nI would like to take some time to consider these options before making a decision. Could you please provide me with more details on how the travel credits work and if there are any limitations or expiration dates associated with them? This information will help me make an informed choice on how to proceed.\n\n\n\nAGENT:   Of course, I understand. Our travel credits are valid for one year from the date of issue and can be used on any of our flights within that timeframe. The credits are non-transferable and can only be used by the original ticket holder.\n\nPlease note that there may be some restrictions or blackout dates when using travel credits, depending on our promotions and special offers. However, I can check for any available travel credits in your account and provide you with more detailed information on how to use them.\n\nWould you like me to check your account for any available travel credits, and I can provide you with more information on how to use them? Or do you have any other questions or concerns regarding our travel credits?\n\n\n\nCUSTOMER: Thank you for the detailed information on the travel credits. I appreciate knowing the validity period and the terms associated with them.\n\nI would like to proceed with checking my account for any available travel credits and understanding how to use them.

I'm glad to hear that you're considering the travel credits. Let me check your account for you. \n\n[Pause for checking the account]\n\nAlright, I can confirm that we can issue travel credits equivalent to the value of your current ticket. Once the credits are issued, you'll be able to use them to book any of our flights within the next year. You can do this by logging into your account on our website or app, selecting the flight you want to book, and then choosing the option to pay with travel credits at the checkout. \n\nPlease note that if the new flight costs more than your available credits, you'll need to pay the difference. Conversely, if the new flight costs less, the remaining credits will stay in your account until they expire or are used up.\n\nI hope this information helps! If you decide to go ahead with the travel credits, I can process that for you right now. Or, if you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask."}

When you opt for travel credits instead of a refund, we convert the value of your ticket into credits that you can use for future travel. These credits are valid for one year from the original date of your flight.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1. The credits can be used to book any flight operated by Yale Airline, subject to availability.\n2. The credits cannot be transferred to another person. They must be used by the person whose name is on the original ticket.\n3. If the new flight that you book is more expensive than your original flight, you will need to pay the difference. If it's less expensive, the remaining balance will stay in your account as credit.\n4. If you do not use all of your credits within one year, any remaining balance will be forfeited.\n\nI hope this information helps!

However, I can offer you some alternative solutions that might be helpful in this situation. \ud83e\udd14\n\nFirstly, travel credits can be used as a form of payment for future flights with our airline. The value of the credit would be equivalent to the cost of your current ticket. This way, you can use the credit towards a future flight that works better for you. \ud83d\udeec\n\nAlternatively, depending on the circumstances, we might be able to offer you travel credits or the possibility of a one-time rescheduling, subject to applicable fees. Please let me know if either of these options sounds appealing to you. \ud83e\udd14\n\nI understand that this might not be the solution you were hoping for, but I hope one of these options can help you in some way. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help. \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\n\nCUSTOMER: I appreciate your understanding and the alternative solutions you've offered. However, I must insist on requesting a full refund without any penalties. I understand the policy regarding non-refundable and non-changeable tickets, but I believe my situation warrants an exception.\n\nI booked the ticket in error just one day ago and have not used it. I hope you can empathize with my predicament and help me out in this instance. I would be grateful if you could escalate this matter to your supervisor or someone who has the authority to make an exception to the policy.\n\nI understand if this is not a common request, but I sincerely hope you can assist me in this matter. Thank you for your understanding and support.\n\n[/INST]\n\n", "completion": "AGENT: I completely understand your concerns and I appreciate your patience in this matter.

I understand that this may be disappointing, but I hope you can appreciate our policy is in place to ensure fairness and consistency for all of our customers.\n\nIf you're looking for alternative solutions, I can offer you travel credits that can be used towards future flights with us. These credits are valid for one year from the date of issuance and can be used towards any of our flights. Alternatively, you can also consider rescheduling your flight for a later date, subject to our change and cancel policy.\n\nPlease let me know if either of these options works for you, or if you have any other questions or concerns. I'm here to help.\n\n\n\nCUSTOMER: I understand your policy, but I really need a full refund for this ticket. Is there any way you can escalate this or speak to a supervisor to see if an exception can be made in my case? I had a sudden change in my plans, and I really need the refund. I would greatly appreciate any help you can provide in this matter.\n\n\n\nAGENT: I understand your situation and I'm really sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you. I can definitely escalate this to my supervisor for further review. However, I must inform you that our policy for non-refundable and non-changeable tickets is strictly enforced and exceptions are typically made only in extraordinary circumstances such as a serious medical emergency or death in the immediate family.\n\nIf you believe your case falls under these exceptional circumstances, you would need to provide appropriate documentation for us to consider a waiver of the policy. If not, I'm afraid the chances of getting a full refund are quite slim.\n\nI can assure you that we will do our best to assist you. Would you like me to proceed with the escalation?\n\n\n\nCUSTOMER: Yes, please go ahead and escalate this to your supervisor. I understand the policy, but I believe my situation is urgent and warrants an exception. I will provide any necessary documentation to support my case. Thank you for your help in this matter.\n\n\n\nAGENT: I understand your situation and I'm here to assist you. I will escalate this matter to my supervisor for further review. They will be able to provide more insight and possibly offer a resolution that aligns with our policies while addressing your concerns. \n\nPlease be prepared to provide any necessary documentation to support your case. This could include medical certificates or other relevant documents depending on the nature of your situation. \n\nThank you for your patience and understanding. I will now transfer your call to my supervisor. Please hold the line for a moment.\n\n\n\nCUSTOMER: Thank you for your assistance. I appreciate your help in escalating this matter.

As I mentioned earlier, we can explore other options like travel credits or a one-time rescheduling, subject to applicable fees.

They will be able to assess your situation and provide a more personalized solution.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can do to assist you.
